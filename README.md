# option-chain-analysis
In this project I have taken option chain data of BANKNIFTY from NSE website, refined it to contain only the strike prices of spot price +-600.
graph.py gives graph of put-call ratio vs time on a realtime basis for intervals of 5 minutes.

This project is not complete !

Trying git using linux
